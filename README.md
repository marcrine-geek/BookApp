## About the Project:

â€œBook Review" is a book-tracking application built using NodeJS and MongoDB. The app is similar to Goodreads and allows users to keep track of books they have read, are currently reading, and want to read in the future. Users can also rate and review books, create and join book clubs, and discover new books to read through personalized recommendations.

The app utilizes MongoDB as its database management system, allowing high scalability and fast data retrieval. Additionally, NodeJS is used to handling the application's backend services, such as user authentication, book data management, and communication with the Open Library API for search functionality.
